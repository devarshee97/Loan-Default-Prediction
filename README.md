# Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository is to contain my experience with applying ML models in sufficiently challenging tasks available in Kaggle and described below.
1. **Loan Default Prediction**: The objective is to determine whether a person applying for a loan amount will be defaulted, considering their financial background and
specific personal details. This is a part of an ongoing Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/credit-default-prediction-ai-big-data/overview.
My goal is to convert this project to an end-to-end mode such that the model deployed can be freely used by any user.
